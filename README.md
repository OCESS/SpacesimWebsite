# Spacesim Website

The current Space Sim website is in need of an update. This new website aims to be clean, easy to navigate and be regularly updated.

## Setting up a Development Environment

You will need Node.js (NPM should come with Node).

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open a terminal in the repo's root directory and type `npm install -D`.
3. Done! To build, just type `gulp` in a terminal.
