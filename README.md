# Spacesim Website

The current Space Sim website is in need of an update. This new website aims to be clean, easy to navigate and be regularly updated.

## Setting up a Development Environment

You will need Node.js (NPM should come with Node). It is recommended that you use the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager instead of NPM. Yarn is backwards-compatible with NPM, but it's faster to install packages and ensures that everyone has the same development environment.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open a terminal in the repo's root directory and type `yarn` if you're using Yarn or `npm install` if you're using NPM. This will installed all required packages to build the website.
3. To build, just type `gulp` in a terminal. The website will be in `dist/`.
